---

<!-- _class: activity -->

## Overview

AS AN employee <br/>
I WANT to keep a count of all the tickets I have completed <br/>
SO THAT I can manage my workflow<br/><br/>

AS AN employee <br/>
I WANT to be able to track the number of tickets my coworkers have completed <br/>
SO THAT I can compare the number of tickets we complete<br/><br/>

Your task is to create a ticket tracking system. Each employee is on the data file and should be
able to increment/decrement their ticket count.
Please see the attached image.

### Requirements

1. Should be built in React + Typescript
2. Each component should manage its own state
3. The components should be generated using a map()

### Extension

1. Add a search by name box
2. Add a select by role dropdown box

### Plan

- Create the components you think you will need (at least an employee component,
  possibly more)
- Map over the data file below to create the components
- Pass data into them via props
- Use State to handle the increment and decrement of tickets
- Style it however you like, but donâ€™t leave it blank
- Should work on mobile devices

### Data

Your coach will provide you with the mock data to use.
